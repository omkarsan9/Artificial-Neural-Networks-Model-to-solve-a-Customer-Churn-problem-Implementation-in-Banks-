# Artificial-Neural-Networks-Model-to-solve-a-Customer-Churn-problem-Implementation-in-Banks-
-Solved a data analytics challenge for a Bank. -Developed and Implemented Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn).  -Succeeded in this project, gave significant added value to the Bank, by applying Deep Learning model so that the bank may significantly reduce customer churn. -Evaluated the performance of models with the most relevant technique, k-Fold Cross Validation also implemented Keras, Theano and Tensorflow.
